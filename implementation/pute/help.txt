	Performance Unit Test Evaluator (PUTE)

This software is used for comparing performance test results.
To compare your test results you have to run your own performance 
tests in a supported benchmark framework and produce output 
in a supported format.

Supported frameworks and formats:

-	BenchmarkDotNet framework - result in JSON format
-	JMH framework - result in JSON format

For a comparison of two test results, benchmarks have to be run on 
the same set of tests. Test-result files have to be given as arguments
on the command line.
